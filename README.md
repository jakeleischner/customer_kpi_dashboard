Overview:
This project simulates a program operations analyst supporting a portfolio of strategic customers. The goal is to monitor performance, identify risk signals, and provide actionable insights to leadership.

## Key Business Questions

1. How concentrated is revenue among the top-performing customers, and what risk does this create?

2. How do strategic (top 20%) customers differ from non-strategic customers in revenue stability and purchasing behavior?

3. What portion of total revenue is driven by high-value accounts versus the broader customer base?

4. How consistent are revenue trends across customer segments over time?

5. What operational patterns (deal size, order frequency, status mix) differentiate strategic accounts?

Data:
The dataset represents a fictional portfolio of strategic customers and includes:
  Revenue and contract value
  SLA compliance and delivery performance
  Support tickets and escalations
  Customer satisfaction indicators

Tools Used
  Excel (data cleaning & KPI creation)
  Tableau (dashboard and visualization)
  GitHub (project documentation)

## Key Insights

### 1. Revenue Concentration Risk
Approximately 40.9% of total revenue is generated by the top 20% of customers, indicating meaningful revenue concentration.

### 2. Strategic vs. Non-Strategic Revenue Behavior
Revenue trends show that strategic accounts provide consistent baseline revenue, while non-strategic accounts exhibit greater volatility over time.

### 3. Customer Performance Distribution
Top-performing accounts significantly outperform the median customer in both revenue and order frequency, reinforcing the value of segmentation.

### 4. Deal Size & Purchasing Patterns
Strategic customers demonstrate higher average deal sizes and more consistent purchasing behavior.

## Recommendations

### 1. Formalize Strategic Account Management
Given that a meaningful share of total revenue is concentrated within the top 20% of customers, implement a structured account management process for strategic accounts to protect core revenue.

**Recommended actions:**
- Establish monthly performance reviews for strategic accounts
- Assign clear account ownership and renewal/retention planning
- Monitor early-warning signals (declining order frequency, shrinking average deal size)

---

### 2. Reduce Revenue Concentration Risk
While strategic accounts provide stability, heavy dependence on a small segment increases exposure to churn and demand shocks. Build a stronger mid-tier to diversify revenue over time.

**Recommended actions:**
- Identify high-growth mid-tier customers (“emerging strategic”) using revenue trajectory
- Launch targeted cross-sell / upsell initiatives by product line
- Track movement of customers between tiers quarter-over-quarter

---

### 3. Segment Service Levels by Customer Tier
Strategic customers show larger deal sizes and more consistent purchasing behavior. Align service delivery and engagement strategy to customer value.

**Recommended actions:**
- Implement tiered support (premium service for strategic accounts)
- Tailor outreach cadence and escalation paths by tier
- Customize product-line offers based on historical purchasing patterns

---

### 4. Institutionalize Executive KPI Monitoring
Make segmentation and concentration visible through a small set of recurring metrics.

**Track monthly:**
- % Revenue from Strategic Customers
- Revenue growth by segment (Strategic vs Non-Strategic)
- Order frequency by segment
- Average deal size by segment

The organization benefits from strong high-value accounts, but long-term resilience will depend on balancing revenue concentration with scalable mid-tier customer growth.
